README — 4 rue Paillet (Paris 5e) – Off-Market Acquisition Analysis
Purpose of this folder

This folder contains all reference material used to evaluate and negotiate the potential off-market acquisition of an apartment located at 4 rue Paillet, 75005 Paris (Quartier Sorbonne).

The objective is not to produce a generic valuation, but to:

assess fair market value using official transaction data,

compare it to a specific off-market offer made to the owner,

and support a negotiation strategy where the buyer is a neighbouring owner for whom the asset has unique strategic value.

Claude should reason as a financially disciplined buyer, not as a broker optimising for headline price.

Property facts (ground truth)

Address: 4 rue Paillet, 75005 Paris

Type: Apartment (copropriété)

Surface (Loi Carrez): 58.48 m²

Condition: Very poor / full renovation required

Status: Off-market discussion with current owner (no public listing)

Buyer context (important)

Buyer already owns the adjacent apartment.

Acqn would allow a logical extension / merger of the two units.

This creates specific, non-transferable value for this buyer only.

Buyer is willing to pay a controlled premium, but not an irrational one.

Claude should explicitly distinguish:

market value vs

buyer-specific strategic premium.

Market references included in this folder
1. DVF (Demande de Valeurs Foncières)

Official notarised transaction data from data.gouv.fr, filtered to:

Paris 5e arrondissement

4 rue Paillet cadastralparcel

2021–2025

Key comparable already identified:

10/10/2024 — 100 m² apartment sold for €1,220,000

≈ €12,200 / m²

Same building

Better condition

Much larger surface

This comparable is central to the analysis.

2. Notaires de Paris price references

Quartier Sorbonne median price: ~€12,600 / m²

Market trend: flat to declining over the last 12–18 months

These figures are statistical anchors, not negotiation prices.

3. Renovation assumptions

Full renovation required

Typical Paris 5e full gut renovation:

€1,800–2,500 / m²

Renovation implies:

direct cost

execution risk

illiquidity discount

Claude should not ignore this.

Offer context (critical)

Buyer has made an off-market offer of €800,000.

This implies:

≈ €13,680 / m²

Higher €/m² sold in the same building

Offer includes:

speed

certainty

no agency fees

zero marketing risk

Claude should treat €800k as already generous, not a low anchor.

What Claude should help with

Claude is expected to:

sanity-check valuation logic,

stress-test negotiation positions,

help draft disciplined, non-emotional messaging,

identify when not acting is the optimal move,

avoid broker-style optimism or sunk-cost bias.

Claude should challenge assumptions if needed, but always:

grounded in DVF / Notaires data,

adjusted for condition and liquidity,

conscious of negotiation dynamics.

What Claude should NOT do

Do not suggest pricing based on 2022 peak conditions.

Do not assume emotional urgency from buyer circumstances.

Doot optimise for “getting the deal done at any cost”.

Do not ignore silence as a negotiation signal.

Bottom line framing

This is a case of:

A disciplined buyer offering above-market €/m² for a worse asset because of unique adjacency value — in a flat or declining market.

All reasoning should flow from that premise.
