# Debate Preparation - Defending the €700k Offer

## Quick Reference Card

**If seller says:** "Your comparable is 100m², mine is 58m² - that suppresses the €/m²!"
**You respond:** "You're absolutely right, and I've adjusted for that. I added €600-800/m² to account for the size premium on smaller apartments. That's why my baseline is €12,800-13,000/m², not the raw €12,200/m² from the RDC."

---

**If seller says:** "You're inflating renovation costs to justify a discount!"
**You respond:** "I actually split this into two analyses. Market-standard renovation is €190-230k. My personal choice to do luxury finishes (€345k) is separate. The market values properties based on standard renovation, which is what I used in the pricing. My luxury choices are my own expense that don't change your property's market value."

---

**If seller says:** "You're double-counting the structural risk!"
**You respond:** "The structural issues create real uncertainty for any buyer - cost uncertainty (€30-80k range) and execution risk. A 6% discount (about €45k on a €750k base) is within the reasonable range for this level of uncertainty. This isn't double-counting; it's accounting for risk that hasn't been eliminated yet."

---

**If seller says:** "You have all the leverage - you own the adjacent unit. This is worth more to you!"
**You respond:** "I agree completely, which is why I'm offering €700k instead of €650-680k that a market buyer would offer. That extra €30-50k represents the adjacency premium. But that premium has limits - I still need the economics to make sense. At €800k+, even with adjacency, the all-in cost becomes irrational."

---

**If seller says:** "Other people would pay more!"
**You respond:** "They might *ask* for more, but actual sales are what matter. The DVF shows what buyers *actually paid*: €12,200/m² for a 100m² unit in better condition than yours. With your size adjustment, structural issues, and need for full renovation, €700k is at the top of the defensible range. Plus, I'm cash, fast, and taking on the structural dossier immediately."

---

**If seller says:** "You're trying to steal this property!"
**You respond:** "Let's look at the numbers: Market baseline with size adjustment is €12,800-13,000/m² (€750-760k). Less 6% structural discount (€45-46k) puts us at €705-714k. I'm offering €700k, which is at the low end of that range - but remember, I'm also offering certainty, speed, cash, and immediate resolution of the structural issue. No agency fees, no financing risk, no lengthy sale process."

## Detailed Counter-Arguments

### 1. Size Premium Challenge

**Seller's strong form:** "You used a 100m² comparable to anchor at €12,200/m², but academic studies show 10-15% premiums for sub-60m² units. Your adjustment of €600-800/m² (5-7%) is still suppressing the value. The true baseline should be €13,500-14,000/m²."

**Your response:**
"Let's test that claim against multiple data points:

1. **DVF renovated unit (115m²):** €16,020/m² turn-key. If we subtract standard renovation premium (€3,200-3,500/m²), that implies €12,520-12,820/m² base value - very close to my €12,800-13,000 range.

2. **Notaires Sorbonne median:** €12,660/m² across all sizes. This is a blended rate that already includes the small apartment premium in the mix.

3. **My adjustment:** €600-800/m² represents 5-7%, which is appropriate for this specific case because:
   - Not a studio (higher premium) but a 2-room apartment
   - Raw condition (premium narrows for properties needing work)
   - Structural issues (unique to this unit)

If we went to €13,500-14,000/m² baseline, we'd be claiming your apartment in *raw condition with structural issues* should be worth more per m² than the €12,660 Notaires median, which includes many renovated units. That doesn't hold up.

The burden of proof is on the higher valuation. My €12,800-13,000/m² is:
- Above the DVF comparable (✓)
- In line with the Notaires median (✓)
- Supported by the renovated comparable when you back out the renovation premium (✓)"

---

### 2. Renovation Cost Inflation Challenge

**Seller's strong form:** "You claim €3,910/m² for renovation, but contractors quote €2,500-3,000/m² for quality work. You're inflating costs by 30-50% to create a false need for a discount. Market-quality renovation for this property is €165-200k, not €257k."

**Your response:**
"You've actually identified exactly what I clarified in the updated analysis. There are two completely separate concepts:

**Market-standard renovation (€190-230k):** This is what a typical buyer budgets for quality renovation - new electrical/plumbing to code, functional kitchen and bathroom, standard flooring, paint. This is what's reflected in market pricing. When buyers see a property, they mentally calculate: 'Purchase price + €2,500/m² + structural work = my all-in cost.'

**My personal renovation choice (€345k):** I renovated the adjacent apartment with luxury finishes - imported parquet, custom cabinetry, marble, integrated smart systems. That's a *personal choice* that reflects how I want to live, not what the market requires.

Here's the critical point: **I valued your property using market-standard costs (Scenario A in my analysis), not my luxury costs.**

Look at Section 6:
- Scenario A (market buyer): €700k purchase + €210k standard renovation = €15,564/m² all-in
- Scenario B (my luxury choice): €700k purchase + €345k luxury renovation = €17,871/m² all-in

The market values your property on Scenario A. The fact that *I personally choose* to spend €345k doesn't change *your property's value* - it just means I'm spending extra on my own preferences.

The €700k price is based on market-standard renovation assumptions, not inflated luxury costs."

---

### 3. Structural Risk Double-Counting Challenge

**Seller's strong form:** "You take the high end of renovation estimates (€345k includes €60k structural), apply a risk premium to that, then demand a price discount. You're pricing the same risk three times: once in the cost estimate, once in the contingency, once in the price discount. Classic anchoring bias."

**Your response:**
"This is a fair critique of how the *original* buyer model might have been interpreted, but let's clarify what's actually in the €700k offer:

**The €700k offer is NOT based on triple-counting.** Here's the actual logic:

1. **Market baseline (size-adjusted):** €12,800-13,000/m² × 58.48m² = €748-760k
   - This is for a property that needs renovation but has NO structural issues

2. **Structural discount:** 6% = €45-46k
   - This is a *single* discount to account for:
     - Uncertain cost range (€30-80k identified by BE)
     - Execution risk and delays
     - Taking on a pre-existing problem

3. **Net offer:** €748k - €46k = €702k ≈ **€700k**

Now, regarding my *personal all-in cost* (the €345k renovation figure):
- The €60k structural estimate in my personal budget is MY planning assumption for MY renovation
- It's not used to calculate YOUR property's market value
- Your property's value is calculated from market baseline minus structural discount
- What I personally spend is irrelevant to your sales price

Think of it this way: If you were selling a car with a dented door:
- Market value of clean car: €20,000
- Discount for dent: -€1,000
- Offer: €19,000

The buyer might choose to:
- Get it fixed cheaply (€500)
- Get luxury body work (€1,500)
- Leave it as-is (€0)

Those choices don't change the car's value. The €1,000 discount reflects the market impact of having a dented door, not the buyer's personal repair choices.

Same logic here: Your property's value is market baseline minus structural discount. What I personally spend to fix it is separate."

### 4. Adjacency Premium Challenge

**Seller's strong form:** "You've assigned yourself ALL the strategic value and me ZERO premium. I hold a monopoly asset - there will never be another adjacent apartment available. The option value of this opportunity is worth far more than €30-50k to you. In M&A terms, control premiums run 20-40%. You should be paying €850k-950k."

**Your response:**
"Let's think through the adjacency value carefully:

**What adjacency is worth TO ME:**
- Ability to merge units in future: requires major renovation (€200k+) and 2-3 years
- Optionality value: I don't *need* to merge; I could sell individually later
- Lifestyle value: somewhat nicer to have a larger combined space
- Rough personal value: €40-60k maximum

**What adjacency is worth TO YOU (the seller):**
- Zero on the open market (next buyer doesn't own adjacent unit)
- But: you can negotiate with the one buyer who values it (me)
- Economic rent extraction: you capture some of my surplus

**What's a fair split?**
Let's say a market buyer offers €650-680k (no adjacency premium). I value it at €690-710k with adjacency. The surplus to split is €10-60k.

A 50/50 split would put us at: Market value (€665k midpoint) + half surplus (€25k) = **€690k**.

My offer of €700k is actually generous: it's giving you more than half the surplus.

**Why not the M&A control premium analogy?**
M&A control premiums apply when acquiring a majority stake gives you *control* of cash flows and operations. That's a 20-40% premium on a *performing asset generating returns*.

This is different:
- No immediate cash flows (not a rental property)
- I don't control anything by buying it (no board seats, no operational control)
- The merger is years away and requires massive additional investment
- The 'synergy' is entirely lifestyle/convenience, not financial

A better analogy is a *land assembly* scenario: Developer wants to assemble 5 parcels to build a larger project. Each holdout tries to extract maximum value. What actually happens:
- Developer pays 10-20% premium vs. market (not 100%+)
- If holdouts demand too much, developer walks and builds around them
- Market value sets the floor, synergy value caps the ceiling

At €700k, I'm paying a ~6-7% premium over what other buyers would offer. That's reasonable for adjacency. At €850-950k, you're asking me to pay 25-40% premium, which makes no economic sense - I'd rather:
- Wait and see if another unit becomes available in 5-10 years
- Buy a different larger apartment elsewhere for less
- Stay with my current single unit"

---

### 5. "Other Buyers Would Pay More" Challenge

**Seller's strong form:** "I've seen smaller apartments in the 5th listed at €14,000-15,000/m² for properties in similar condition. You're cherry-picking the lowest comparables. If I listed this on the open market, I'd get €820-870k."

**Your response:**
"Let's separate *asking prices* from *transaction prices*:

**Asking prices (what sellers hope for):**
- Represent seller's aspirations, not market reality
- Often sit unsold for months, then sell for 10-15% below ask
- Self-selected bias: the highest asks are what you notice online

**Transaction prices (what buyers actually pay):**
- DVF: €12,200/m² for 100m² raw unit in your building (Oct 2024)
- Notaires: €12,660/m² median for Quartier Sorbonne
- DVF: €16,020/m² for 115m² renovated unit in your building

Now let's test your scenario:

**If you listed at €820k (€14,020/m²):**

Challenges you'd face:
1. **Comparable problem:** Buyer's agent pulls DVF data, sees €12,200/m² for larger unit in better condition. Immediate question: 'Why is this one 15% more expensive per m²?'

2. **Condition disclosure:** Full renovation required + structural issues. Buyer calculates: €820k + €210k renovation + €50k structural = €1,080k all-in = €18,465/m². That's above turn-key market (€16,000-16,500/m²).

3. **Financing hurdle:** Bank appraiser sees the DVF comparable and values your property at €720-750k. Buyer's loan gets reduced or denied. Sale falls through.

4. **Time cost:** Property sits for 3-6 months while you wait for the 'right buyer.' Carrying costs, uncertainty, market risk.

**If you listed at €870k (€14,875/m²):**
- Even more extreme version of the above
- Almost certainly results in no offers or very low offers after sitting
- Eventual price reduction to €750-780k after 6 months
- Net outcome: same price range, but 6 months later

**What I'm offering:**
- €700k cash, immediate, no contingencies
- I take the structural dossier off your hands today
- No agency fees (saves you 5% × €820k = €41k if you listed)
- No market timing risk
- No financing fall-through risk

Net-net: You could *try* for €820k listed price, but after:
- 5% agency fee: -€41k
- 3-6 months carrying costs/uncertainty: -€15k opportunity cost
- Likely negotiation down: -€40-60k
- Risk of structural discount in appraisal: -€30-50k

You'd likely end up at €670-710k net, 6 months from now, with significant stress.

Or: Accept €700k today, cash, certainty, close in 6-8 weeks."

### 6. "You're Trying to Steal This" Challenge

**Seller's strong form (emotional):** "You're taking advantage of my situation with the structural issue. You know I'm motivated to sell because of this problem, and you're using that leverage to get an unfair price. This feels exploitative."

**Your response (empathetic but firm):**
"I understand this feels difficult, and I want to be direct about the dynamics here:

**What I'm NOT doing:**
- I'm not creating artificial urgency or pressure
- I'm not hiding information or misrepresenting the market
- I'm not making a lowball offer to 'steal' the property
- Every number in my analysis is sourced and verifiable

**What IS true:**
The structural issue is a real problem that affects market value. It's not something I caused, but it's something any buyer must account for. Here's what a market buyer thinks:

'This apartment needs:
- Full renovation: €190-230k
- Structural work: €30-80k range (uncertain)
- 9-12 months of my time managing contractors
- Risk that structural costs balloon
- Risk of delays, permitting issues, copropriété friction'

That buyer offers €650-680k because they see downside risk and opportunity cost.

**What I'm offering that's better:**
- €700k (€20-50k above market buyer)
- Cash, fast, no contingencies
- I take on ALL the structural risk and execution burden
- You walk away clean with no further exposure

**The adjacency factor:**
Yes, I have a unique interest. But that cuts both ways:
- You benefit: I'm paying more than market
- I benefit: I get optionality for future merger

That's a fair exchange. I'm not asking you to give me the adjacency value - I'm paying for it.

**The bottom line:**
€700k is a *fair* price given market data, property condition, and structural uncertainty. It's not a steal - it's a fair market transaction where both parties get reasonable value.

If you truly believe it's worth €820-870k, then you should test the market. I respect that choice. But I've done the analysis, and I don't believe the market will support that price. My offer of €700k stands if you'd prefer certainty and speed.

This isn't about 'taking advantage' - it's about finding a number that reflects reality and works for both of us."

## When to Walk Away

**Walk away if seller:**
1. Demands >€730k as a firm floor (hits your walk-away threshold)
2. Refuses to acknowledge market data (DVF, Notaires) as legitimate
3. Insists structural discount should be zero despite BE report
4. Claims adjacency is worth €200k+ premium (economically irrational)
5. Becomes adversarial rather than collaborative

**Phrases that signal you should walk:**
- "I know what I have" (ignoring market data)
- "Someone else will pay more" (without evidence)
- "This is my final offer" at €800k+ (above your ceiling)
- "The structural issue is your problem after you buy it" (unreasonable)

**Your walk-away line:**
"I appreciate the conversation. I've put a lot of thought into a fair price based on market data. €700k represents a strong offer given the property's condition and current market. If we're too far apart on valuation, I respect that - but I can't go higher and have the economics make sense. I'll leave the offer open for [X weeks] if you'd like to reconsider, but I understand if you want to pursue other options."

---

## Key Principles for the Debate

1. **Stay data-driven:** Every claim backed by DVF, Notaires, or industry-standard assumptions
2. **Acknowledge valid points:** "You're right about X, which is why I adjusted for it"
3. **Separate market value from personal choices:** Your luxury renovation costs ≠ property's value
4. **Be willing to walk:** €730k is your ceiling; don't let negotiation pressure push you higher
5. **Maintain respect:** This is your future neighbor; don't burn bridges

## Final Thought

The seller may push back hard, but remember: **You've already compromised significantly from your market-rational target (€615k) to €700k.** That €85k premium represents:
- Recognition of adjacency value
- Goodwill as a neighbor
- Premium for speed and certainty

If the seller wants €800k+, they're asking you to pay a 30%+ premium over your target with no additional justification. That's when you walk.

Your offer is fair. Stand behind it.
